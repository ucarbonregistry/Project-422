Good Earth Melange Owners' Association (GEMOA) is the owner’s association of the residential units
located in Good Earth Melange - a residential complex situated in Kochi, in the state of Kerala, in
India.

Good Earth Melange is a tropical high rise apartment building, a green alternative which responds to
and takes advantages of the climate and location. The design of the complex minimizes the common
walls between apartments. The units are designed as homes that open up to the verandahs and sky
gardens. The cavity walls capture the hot air which is expelled using air vents on the roof, keeping
the indoors cool. The lobby also has been designed as an extension of the landscape with sky
gardens. The design attempts to break away from the typical apartment plan to bring in elements of
a home in space planning.

Apart from the facilities and amenities within Good Earth Melange, the complex taken series of
innovative measures for sustainable living. They have rainwater harvesting system which captures
the rainwater and instead of allowing it to run off to the local riverine system, it is fed to the local
aquifer thereby reducing the depletion of ground water resources.
